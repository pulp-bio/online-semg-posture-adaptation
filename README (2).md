# Event-based Low-Power and Low-Latency Regression Method for Hand Kinematics from Surface EMG



## Introduction
Code to reproduce our paper "Event-based Low-Power and Low-Latency Regression Method for Hand Kinematics from Surface EMG" [1].



## Usage
1. Run ``spikification.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``spikification.py``) to spikify the NinaPro Database 8. 
2. Run ``experiment_taus.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``experiment_taus.py``) for the regression epxeriments.
3. Run ``read_results.ipynb`` to get the results statistics.
