# Online Unsupervised Arm Posture Adaptation for sEMG-based Gesture Recognition on a Parallel Ultra-Low-Power Microcontroller



## Introduction
Code to reproduce our paper "Online Unsupervised Arm Posture Adaptation for sEMG-based Gesture Recognition on a Parallel Ultra-Low-Power Microcontroller" [1].



## Usage
1. Run ``experiment_multiposture.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``experiment_multiposture.py``) to perform the baseline experiments with multi-posture training. 
2. Run ``experiment_calibmodes.ipynb`` (or equivalently ``experiment_calibmodes.py``) for the online PCA posture adaptation experiments.
3. Run ``read_results.ipynb`` to get the results statistics.
